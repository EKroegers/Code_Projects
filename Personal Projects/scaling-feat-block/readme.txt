Advanced TTRPG Feat block scaffolded with Create Block tool.

== Description ==

This is an advanced block used for the display of content in the format of TTRPG
feats. This includes the name of the feat (featTitle), an optional (showFlavorField)
field for flavor text for the feat (featFlavor), the description of the 
prerequisite or prerequisites of the feat (featPrerequisites), the description 
of the benefit of the feat (featBenefit), usually what the thresholds are based off of.
There is then a secondary section of benefits (featScaleBenefit1-10) split into 
sections that scale by a provided selector (featScaleThreshold1-10), and a 
toggleable field (showSpecialField) which concerns the special aspects of a feat 
description, often containing additional mechanical information realted to the 
function of the feat (featSpecials).

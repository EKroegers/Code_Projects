# Sprint Execution:
## Sprint Planning:
### *Inputs (all found in the main branch within the doc directory):*
* **Product backlog:** The initial product backlog is included above in the SDP. A separate product backlog called product-backlog.md is the official and up to date version of the backlog. It will be kept directly in the doc directory.
* **Sprint backlog:** The sprint backlog relating to the current sprint will be kept in the doc directory. Sprint backlogs for older sprints will be found within the doc/sprint-backlogs directory. Upon completion of the final sprint all sprint backlogs will be in the doc/sprint-backlogs directory. The filenames will be “sprint-<sprint number>-backlog.md”. ie. sprint-1-backlog.md

### *Team Activity:*
* Product Owner – Updates product backlog to contain updated requirements - Jacob Sobiech
* Scrum Master – Works with the team and product owner to define the new sprint backlog. Submits sprint backlogs - Derrick Thompson
* Development Team – Provides feedback on task efforts and sprint backlog - Alex Crabtree, Derrick Thompson, Ethan Kroeger, Jacob Sobiech
* All members define what “Done” is

### *Outputs (all found in the main branch within the doc directory):*
* Refined product backlog: see notes on product backlogs above. The file is called product-backlog.md
* Updated sprint backlog: see notes on sprint backlogs above. All sprint backlogs will be in the doc/product-backlogs directory except for the one for the current sprint which will reside in doc/.

## Daily Scrum:
### *Inputs:*
* Sprint backlog
### *Team Activity:*
* Scrum master – polls the team as to the status
* Development Team – provides status on progress and other needs
### *Outputs:*
* Updated sprint backlog
* Meeting minutes

## Sprint Review:
### *Inputs:*
* Sprint backlog
### *Team Activity:*
* Sprint Review
* Stakeholders updated with latest status
### *Outputs:*
* Version of stock market simulation will be available once the code is integrated enough to run as a single program. At that point all code will be forked into a new branch. While the code does not meet the standard of a minimum viable product the forked code will be forked with the branch title “release 0.X” where X is the current sprint. Once the minimum viable product is met (which we will define as 15 total user stories/requirements being met), the subsequent branch will have the name “release 1.X” starting at “release 1.0”.
